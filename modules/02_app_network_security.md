Module 2 — APPLICATION & NETWORK SECURITY: THREATS, ATTACKS & TOOLS

**Security Principles and Zero Trust Architecture**  
Source: TryHackMe / github.com/adebayobasorun  
● Applied CIA/DAD models, ISO guidance and zero trust principles to design least-privilege security architectures.  
● Platforms and Technology Used: Threat models, ATT&CK mapping, architecture diagrams.

**DNS Deep Dive**  
Source: TryHackMe / github.com/adebayobasorun  
● Explored DNS internals, record types and performed hands-on DNS request analysis for misconfigurations and abuse detection.  
● Platforms and Technology Used: dig, DNSdumpster, public resolvers.

**Honeypot and Cowrie Deployment**  
Source: TryHackMe / github.com/adebayobasorun  
● Deployed Cowrie honeypot, captured attacker interactions and analyzed SSH-based bot activity for detection logic.  
● Platforms and Technology Used: Cowrie, Wireshark, Splunk/Wazuh for log ingestion.

**PKI and Cryptography Fundamentals**  
Source: TryHackMe / github.com/adebayobasorun  
● Studied symmetric/asymmetric encryption, hashing and certificate chains and experimented with OpenSSL certificate tasks.
